# Face_Mask_Detection_Based_Door_Lock
This project is based on automatic door opening and closing system that can be implemented using Raspberry PI.

Computer vision technology has been an area of active research for decades because the possibilities of applications are innumerable. The common applications of computer vision and image processing include text recognition, depth perception, visual odometry, object detection and recognition, pose estimation, human face detection and recognition, among many others. Detecting and recognizing objects in a cameraâ€™s field of view is a very important task with applications in automation, robotics, and manufacturing industries.
Face Detection is the application of image processing techniques to determine if the image is/has a human face or not. It is analogous to object detection, but the distinct and consistent features of the human face make face detection a more informed task achievable by hand-tuned feature descriptors and conventional image processing methods.
